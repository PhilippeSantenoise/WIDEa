Description: WIDEa is R-based software aiming to provide users with a range of functionalities to explore, manage, clean and analyse "big" environmental and (in/ex situ) experimental data. These functionalities are the following,
 .
                     1. Loading/reading different data types: basic (called normal), temporal, infrared spectra of mid/near region (called IR) with frequency (wavenumber) used as unit (in cm-1);
 .
                     2. Creation of subsets of data by including several conditions;
 .
                     3. Interactive data visualization from a multitude of graph representations: 2D/3D scatter-plot, box-plot, hist-plot, bar-plot, correlation matrix;
 .
                     4. Manipulation of variables: concatenation of qualitative variables, transformation of quantitative variables by generic functions in R;
 .
                     5. Application of statistical methods (linear regression, density curve, hypothesis testing, etc.);
 .
                     6. Creation/management of data (named flag data) considered as atypical;
 .
                     7. Study of normal distribution model results for different strategies: calibration (checking assumptions on residuals), validation (comparison between measured and fitted values). The model form can be more or less complex: mixed effects, main/interaction effects, weighted residuals.
